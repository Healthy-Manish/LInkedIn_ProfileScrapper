Here\u2019s a breakdown of its core concepts: \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3\ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27? \nIn simple terms, Ridge Regression modifies the linear regression equation\n y = mx + b by shrinking the slope 'm '. It adds a penalty term to the loss function.\nThe idea is we want to reduce 'm' , by doing this the value of bias increased but the variance decreases.\n\n\ud835\udc0b = \u03a3 (\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc22 - \u0177\ud835\udc22)\u00b2 + \u03bb\ud835\udc26\u00b2 (\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc22=\ud835\udfcf \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc27)\n\nThis reduces the slope 'm', increasing bias but decreasing variance, leading to a more generalized model.  The overall slope which is minimum for this equation will be lesser than previous loss function.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d?\nAll coefficients are shrunk toward zero, but they never actually reach zero. As the regularization parameter \u03bb increases, the shrinkage becomes more pronounced.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc07\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc2c. \ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30 \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2c\nLarger coefficients shrink more gently, while smaller coefficients move slowly toward zero. This ensures that no coefficient is eliminated entirely, unlike in Lasso Regression.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c-\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\n- Increasing \u03bb increases bias but reduces variance.\n- Decreasing \u03bb reduces bias but increases variance.\nRidge Regression strikes a balance between these two to prevent overfitting.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\nThe loss function shrinks as \u03bb increases. A higher \u03bb reduces the magnitude of the coefficients, leading to a simpler and more robust model.\n\n\ud83d\udca1\ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b?\nRidge Regression is essential for improving model performance, especially when dealing with multicollinearity or high-dimensional data. It\u2019s a tradeoff between simplicity and accuracy, ensuring your model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\n\u2026more",
